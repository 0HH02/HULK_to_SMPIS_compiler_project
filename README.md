# HULK_to_SMPIS_compiler_project  

A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level language (typically machine code) that a computer can understand and execute. This project aims to implement a compiler for a programming language called HULK (Havana University Language Kompiler), created for academic purposes. The goal is for the program to compile HULK code into SMPIS code.
